Today is October 14th. Almost a year after I decided to transition into a more technical role. The road has not been easy and a lot still remains to be done. However, many valuable skills have been learned along the way. Even though I am not there yet, I appreciate the value I have received from learning. It has made me better at my job and a more well-rounded professional. 

I am looking for more opportunities to apply my more technical skills. However, I also realize that especially now more than ever, marketing your skillset is a skill in an of itself. That is something that I will need to invest more time and attention towards if I want to advance my career, regardless of whether it's a more or less technical role.
